***********************************************

The experiment involved 32 hearing-impaired (HI) participants wearing hearing aids (HAs) with either: 

NRon:  Noise reduction (NR) algorithms turned on, or
NRoff: Noise reduction (NR) algorithms turned off.

Due to bad data quality 2 participants (#14 and #22) are excluded from the data analysis.
After each trial, the participant answerd a yes/no question about the content of the target speaker.
Behavioural data structure (for each subject and each condition (NRon, NRoff)):

Column 1: Correct answer to the question.
Column 2: Participant's answer to the question.
Column 3: Correct answer (1), or incorrect answer (0).

Each row represent one trial.
